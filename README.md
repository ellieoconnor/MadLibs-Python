# MadLibs-Python
Learning how to create MadLibs using Python. Also learning how to manipulate strings.

There are a few ideals I have for this project:
  Firstly, I would like the user inputs to be a different colour than that of the rest of the madlib.
  I would also like for the madlib to be generated. I'm not sure if that will work.
  I want there to be an introductory section too. That part will give instructions...I think maybe a function will do the trick with that.
